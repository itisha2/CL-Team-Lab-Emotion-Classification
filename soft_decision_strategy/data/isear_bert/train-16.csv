I was very angry (as it is I was in a bad mood then).|2.0|-3.6532328128814697|-3.813164472579956|2.165119171142578|-3.4035987854003906|-3.6591622829437256|-3.1567728519439697|-3.1984434127807617|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

Our class had organized a picnic in November.  I was the class representative so I became the organizor.  However the picnic was postponed by one week and I had something else to do then. Initially I did not ponder on what to do and decided to go for the picnic.  When I had the time to think about it I thought that my decision was wrong.  My classmates thought that I would go as I had signed my name but I did not go.  I told another class representative that I was not going but he did not know the reason behind my not going.  After the picnic my classmates asked me why I had not gone to the picnic and everytime someone mentioned it I was apologetic.  I should have decided right in the begining that I would not go and then they would not see me as irresponsible i.e promising to go and changing my mind afterwards.|3.0|-4.245919704437256|-5.574593544006348|-2.2471566200256348|0.31559765338897705|-4.995510101318359|-1.3075249195098877|-3.6116089820861816|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

This is an incident that many of us witness in our everyday life in a city like Bombay.  One day I was travelling by bus, three men dragged two fellows out of the bus.  Once outside they were beaten into pulp.  These two fellows, who got beaten, were pick-pockets and they were being beaten by all and sundry.  I thought to myself -"what is life?".  It is one hell of a place where everyone is after someone else.  One waits to cut the throat of the other one just for a living, (money).  When I think about such things - the purpose of life, etc, I feel very disgusted and dejected.|6.0|-3.7085554599761963|-3.51373291015625|-3.45413875579834|-3.518234968185425|-3.716059684753418|-3.434201717376709|2.9941999912261963|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0

I quarrelled with my brothers (twins) at home on saturday.  One of them studies in a private school and the other one is repeating his form five.  They do not know what they are doing.  They follow every word of their teachers, books and systems.  They always try to rationalize their bad acts by some game and they are satisfied with their awkward life.  I have tried to persuade them very often but have failed.  This time I had a fight as they have no voluntary spirit (they did not polish the floor).|2.0|-3.6525120735168457|-4.2840375900268555|2.0590085983276367|-3.075033664703369|-4.119051933288574|-2.9519288539886475|-2.658310651779175|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

A few days back I was waiting for the bus at the bus stop.  Before getting into the bus I had prepared the exact amount of coins to pay for the bus fair and when I got into the bus I put these coins into the box meant to collect the bus fair.  I thought that I had paid and wanted to get inside.  However the bus driver called me and asked me in an impolite way if the coins were stuck at the opening  of the box.  He had not seen me paying and there wasn't a stack of coins in the box.  I could not understand this and the driver kept questioning me.  He made me feel angry and at last i inserted a dollar coin in the box just to get away from him.  Later I found that I had forgotten a few coins in my pocket and had not paid enough for the fair the first time.  After I had entered the bus I could still hear him scolding me and I felt disgusted.|6.0|-4.076973915100098|-3.7563164234161377|-2.8235843181610107|-3.716670513153076|-4.109478950500488|-3.4903712272644043|2.5868451595306396|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0

I worked with several classmates on a project.  I was very anxious about the project while my partners showed no concern  and when we had meetings on the project my classmates  did not pay any attention.  Some of them read books while the others argued on irrelevant questions.  The meeting would go on for two hours without the main theme being discussed.  We wasted time and could not reach a compromise.  My classmates avoided doing the work and the responsibilities, they seemed to value other projects more than this one.|2.0|-3.610673666000366|-4.751341819763184|1.0405499935150146|-3.605790853500366|-4.662729263305664|-3.636152744293213|-0.8276787400245667|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

He had sold the books and was forced to quit school.  I found that I had not helped him as he stole later on also.
